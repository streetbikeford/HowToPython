## Operators come in many varieties. Arithmetic, logical, assignment, comparison
##identity, etc.  

##Basic arithmetic operators. Begin by assigning 2 variables a value

a = 35
b = 25



print(a + b, 'This is the value of a plus b')
print(a - b, 'This is the value of a minus b')
print(a * b, 'This is the value of a times b')
print(a / b, 'This is the value of a divided by b')
print(a % b, 'This is the value of a divided b with remainder')
print(a ** b, 'This is the value of a to the power of b')


##Comparison Operators
